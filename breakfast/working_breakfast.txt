If transbolloxification is the undescribed dynamic portion of  
failure that occurs between 'object good' and 'object failed',  
can we remove the trans- and ask what is bolloxification?  




Yes. Strip the trans-. Keep the motion implicit.

Bolloxification is what happens after the object is still intact but before it is officially dead.

Not failure.
Not success.
Not rejection.

It is the loss of grip.

An object undergoing bolloxification still has all its parts. The joke is there.  
The idea is there. The craft is there. But the handle is gone.  
People no longer know how to hold it.  


Key properties of bolloxification:

Meaning is still present, but access is noisy  
Viewers feel effort without payoff, or payoff without permission  
The object provokes reaction, but not alignment  
Critique becomes vague - “this sucks,” “I don’t get it,” “why though”  
Defenders cannot articulate defense without sounding like they missed the joke

Importantly: bolloxification is not about quality. Good objects bolloxify all the time.  
In fact, only good-enough objects can bolloxify. Bad ones just fail cleanly.


Bolloxification happens when:

Context outruns framing
Timing outruns literacy
Recognition outruns explanation
Or explanation arrives before recognition

It is the phase where the object is too alive to be ignored and too undefined to be adopted.

That’s why people reach for insults, labels, or blanket bans.  
Those are emergency tools for dealing with bolloxified things.  
The system is trying to stop the wobble.

So if we define it cleanly:

Bolloxification is the process by which an object loses its affordances faster than it loses its visibility.

That’s the danger zone.
That’s also where mutation happens.

Remove the trans-, and you see the truth:
There was never a crossing.
Just a degradation of grip.

Some objects recover.
Some crystallize into templates.
Some become cautionary fossils.

And some - very few - pass through bolloxification and come out as infrastructure.

Those don’t get explained.
They get used.

If you want to push this further, the next cut is obvious:

What is debolloxification - and who performs it, the maker or the crowd?
