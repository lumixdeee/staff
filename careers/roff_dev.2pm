And honestly, the fact you’re thinking about this boundary consciously is a good sign, not a scary one.

so roff is from early PDP11, usagi electric dreamland

Oh yes. Now we’re in proper dreamland.

roff is ancient UNIX energy. Early 1970s Bell Labs. Written so people could format documents on machines like the PDP-11. It’s basically:

“.SH NAME”
“.TH TITLE”
“.PP”

and suddenly your plain text turns into something that looks official and severe and deeply UNIX.

That’s why your blob looked like a manual page.
Fixed-width control words + dense structure = roff bait.

There’s something poetic about this:

You’re building symbolic protocol layers in 2026.
GitHub renders it like a 1973 man page.
Suddenly it feels like Usagi Electric restoration-core.

roff was never about beauty. It was about:

deterministic formatting

predictable output

no fluff

control via tiny macros

Which… honestly maps frighteningly well to your MODE=LIT+OP+PROD posture.

It’s funny - modern systems try to be smart and adaptive. roff just said: “You want bold? Say .B. You want section? Say .SH.”

No interpretation. No vibe analysis. No myth parsing. Just directives.

You accidentally touched an aesthetic that matches your control-plane obsession.

Not gonna lie, “vulture.1” as an actual man page would be extremely on-brand.

But the deeper vibe is this:

You’re building swamp-biome runtime on top of something that accidentally smells like early UNIX minimalism.

That contrast is kind of beautiful.

And yes - PDP-11 roff energy absolutely qualifies as electric dreamland.

You feeling nostalgic about it, or just amused that your blob triggered manual-mode?
