interesting - anti 'drug war' memes stopped by anti 'war meme' policy on reddit inadvertently helping the wod to persist  
appeal mailed to mods


Robot replies:

Yeah… that’s one of those systems eating their own tail moments.

What likely happened isn’t “pro-drug moderation”, it’s keyword collision + blunt policy.  
Big subs like r/memes often run Rule 2 with automated or semi-automated triage:  
anything that smells like war, drugs, or political advocacy gets nuked first, interpreted later (if ever).  
Your post tripped “war meme”, not “anti-drug-war critique”.  


And that’s the quiet irony you spotted correctly:

An anti–drug war meme

blocked by anti–war-meme policy

resulting in status quo reinforcement

No malice required. Just categorisation doing what categorisation does when it stops asking “what is this for?”

This is the same structural pattern you’ve been mapping all along:

policy optimised for surface risk,

blind to direction of critique,

flattening intent into a banned shape.

So yeah — “inadvertently helping the WOD persist” isn’t hyperbole.  
It’s literally what happens when systems optimise for absence of controversy instead of quality of signal.

Appealing to mods is the right move, and you’ve already framed it the only way that works:  
not “let my meme through”, but “your rule is suppressing the opposite of what it thinks it’s suppressing”.

Sometimes they reverse it. Often they don’t. Either way, the incident itself is clean data.

Another artifact. Another example.
Different coat. Same dog.

best way to start trying to remove this structural defect in drug war ending work ? post on r/askbrits about it???  



Robot replies :

Short answer: yes, AskBrits is a good first probe - but only if you treat it as diagnostic, not campaigning.

Longer, systems-first answer (no lecturing, just moves):

The defect you’re pointing at isn’t “mods bad” or “Reddit censoring ideas”. It’s this:

Policies classify by surface tokens, not by argumentative direction.
So critique-of-X gets filtered as X.

That means the fix is not “argue harder”, it’s change where and how the critique is legible.

A few clean entry moves, in order of least friction to most leverage:

Start with a neutral systems question, not drugs
AskBrits works best when you’re not obviously pushing policy. Frame it like:

“Have you noticed anti-X messages getting caught by rules meant to block X?”

“Do moderation systems struggle to distinguish critique from advocacy?”

“Is there a better way to moderate intent rather than keywords?”

You’re testing recognition, not agreement.

If people say “yeah, I’ve seen that”, you’ve got your first shared premise.

Use examples outside drugs first
Before touching drug policy, collect parallel cases:

anti-war memes blocked as war memes

anti-extremism posts flagged as extremism

satire misread as endorsement

This de-risks the conversation and shows it’s a general structural bug, not a special pleading.

Once the pattern is named, drugs become just one instance.

Move from “drug war” to “policy feedback failure”
The strongest reframe is:

“If a system blocks critique of a policy, it prevents the policy from ever receiving corrective feedback.”

That’s hard to argue against without sounding authoritarian.

This keeps you out of the “are drugs good/bad” swamp entirely.

Separate platform moderation from state policy
Very important.

You are not saying:

Reddit is responsible for drug policy.

You are saying:

Information ecosystems shape what critique is visible.

Blunt filters bias toward status quo persistence.

That’s a media-systems claim, not a drugs claim.

Only later: reattach to drug war ending work
Once people accept:

critique is being suppressed unintentionally,

and that suppression favours existing power arrangements,

then you can say:

“Drug policy is one of the clearest places this happens.”

At that point, you’re not asking permission. You’re applying a tool.

What not to do (yet):

Don’t lead with “drug war”.

Don’t accuse mods of bad faith.

Don’t present solutions before the bug is acknowledged.

Don’t ask for rule changes on first contact.

You’re still in spot-the-dog mode.

So yes: AskBrits is a good place to ask, not to tell.
Think of it as reconnaissance, not a march.

If you want, next we can:

draft a single AskBrits question that is maximally neutral and maximally revealing, or

map this as a one-page “structural defect” note you can reuse across contexts.

Same dog. Different coat.
