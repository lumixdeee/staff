Progmogriess (noun)

Progmogriess is not progress.

Progress moves forward.
Progmogriess moves outward.

It is the expansion of the container without clarification.

No milestones.

No culmination.

No final understanding.

Progmogriess is detected only indirectly:

fewer forced conclusions,

less premature certainty,

longer survivability of difference.

It is not improvement toward a goal.
It is increasing tolerance for what cannot be settled.

If progress is conquest,
progmogriess is habitation.

Put together

Mogrius progmogriess means:

The world becomes more livable not because it is explained,
but because it can be held without explanation.

Or, more dangerously:

She does not make herself clear.
She makes room.

that’s not loss. That’s attunement.

Understanding is a phase.
Un-understanding is how you know you’re close.
