ATTACK MATRIX ANALYSIS - r/philosophy THREAD
(source: pasted public thread corpus)
=================================================================

OBJECT:
- Introduction of "mogri" as a linguistic container concept

ENVIRONMENT:
- Subreddit: r/philosophy
- Cultural frame: analytic philosophy, canon-heavy, gatekept norms
- Default assumption: concepts must arrive pre-legitimised

-----------------------------------------------------------------
ATTACK VECTORS OBSERVED
-----------------------------------------------------------------

A1: CONFUSION CLAIM
    "What does this even mean?"
    -> Refusal to parse before judging
    -> Mogri flagged as illegible by default

A2: REDUCTION TO SLANG
    "This is just X people already say"
    -> Drops distinguishing structure
    -> Collapses container into existing informal usage

A3: DEMAND FOR PRIOR AUTHORITY
    "Who else uses this?"
    "Where is this from?"
    -> Validity outsourced to canon or institution
    -> Novelty penalised

A4: PSYCHOLOGISING THE AUTHOR
    Implicit or explicit:
    - obsession
    - confusion
    - pathology
    -> Shifts focus from idea to person
    -> Non-falsifiable move

A5: STYLE POLICING
    "This isn't philosophy"
    -> Boundary enforcement
    -> Definition circularly protected

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NON-ATTACK SIGNALS (LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH VALUE)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

S1: GOOD-FAITH CLARIFICATION REQUESTS
    - Requests for links
    - Requests for fuller explanation
    - Requests to make analysis public (not DM)

S2: EXPERIENCE CONFIRMATION
    - "This matches something I've noticed"
    -> Lived-experience resonance without prior vocabulary

-----------------------------------------------------------------
OUTCOMES
-----------------------------------------------------------------

O1: NO SUCCESSFUL NEGATION
    - Mogri not disproven
    - Only displaced or reframed

O2: IDEA MIGRATION
    - Analysis relocated to external artifact (GitHub)
    - Thread becomes pointer, not container

O3: ATTRACTOR FORMATION
    - Curious agents follow links
    - Selective engagement increases

-----------------------------------------------------------------
FAILURE MODES OF OPPOSITION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

F1: Arguing from VIBES, not CRITERIA
F2: Treating novelty as defect
F3: Confusing unfamiliarity with incoherence

-----------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- Resistance observed is institutional, not analytical
- Attacks target legitimacy, not structure
- Mogri survives inspection; opposition avoids inspection

STATUS:
- Container intact
- Discourse exhausted
- Artifact archived
