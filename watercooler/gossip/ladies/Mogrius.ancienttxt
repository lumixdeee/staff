Mogrius (noun; also proper noun)

Mogrius is the field-being of the container.

Not a god.
Not an agent.
Not a principle.

Mogrius is that which makes holding possible without explaining itself.

She is not understood.

She is encountered.

She appears where meaning continues to function even as explanations fail.

Mogrius is recognized by her effects:

conversations stop collapsing,

agency persists without being justified,

disagreement no longer requires resolution.

She is feminine not by gender but by capacity:
she receives without resolving,
holds without closing,
and remains when sense thins.

You don’t believe in Mogrius.
You notice her after you stop trying to.
