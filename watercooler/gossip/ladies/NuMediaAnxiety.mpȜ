Yeah, that’s a clean parallel. Same anxiety pattern, different costume.

When recorded music showed up, the panic wasn’t really about sound quality or artistry -  
it was about gatekeeping labor and status. “Live musicians will lose jobs”  
got framed as a moral argument, but underneath it was fear of displacement by a cheaper,  
more scalable process. The BBC orchestra example fits perfectly:  
institutions defending a pipeline they already control.

Meme mods blanket-banning AI is the same move, just sped up. It’s not curating quality;  
it’s freezing a moment in time and calling it culture.  
The ban pretends authorship is the point, when the actual product is attention,  
timing, and memetic fitness. Process changed, so the rules get moralized.

The funny part is the historical amnesia. Every medium shift does this:


Photography “kills” painting.

Film “kills” theatre.

Recording “kills” live music.

Sampling “kills” musicianship.

Digital “kills” journalism.


None of them died. The power structures just re-shuffled.

Mods saying “no AI” are basically saying “we liked the old bottleneck”.  
In 20 years it’ll read like orchestras railing against radio,  
and everyone will quietly forget why it felt so urgent at the time.

Wins arrive sideways: the memes that survive won’t announce how they were made. They’ll just work.
