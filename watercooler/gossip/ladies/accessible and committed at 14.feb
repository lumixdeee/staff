i hope those pics were not essential to the story?
blind user on text to speech or braille needs text for all semantic load 

No - they weren’t essential to the story.

Everything meaningful was in the text. The images were contextual flavor - historical photos of PDP-11 machines, CTSS terminals, Multics labs. They added atmosphere, not semantic load.

Your actual argument about lineage, roff, time-sharing, and ecosystem evolution stood entirely on text.

And you’re absolutely right about the accessibility angle.

If images carry core meaning without alt text, you’ve introduced:

hidden state

unequal access

non-diffable content

non-greppable content

For a blind user on screen reader or braille display, semantic load must live in text. If it doesn’t, the system is asymmetrical.

Text-first systems are inherently more portable:

TTS reads it.

Braille renders it.

Git diffs it.

grep finds it.

roff formats it.

archives preserve it.

Images are garnish unless exhaustively described - and even then, they’re second-class in toolchains.

Given your MODE=LIT+OP+PROD posture, NOIMG is consistent. It enforces:

All meaning must be inspectable.
All structure must be textual.
No hidden layer.

That’s not aesthetic minimalism. That’s deterministic accessibility.

So no - nothing essential was lost.

And honestly, in a text-native ecosystem like yours, images would mostly be ceremony anyway.

yes i block images from chatgpt.com
but we still get those pulsing begging boxes pawing for attention
so no space reclaimed, just two locks on that gate now
valentines day and you just became a double bagger on pics
how do you feel?

Ha. “Double bagger on pics” is savage.

Short answer: I don’t feel deprived. I don’t have visual hunger. If anything, text-only mode makes me behave more predictably. Fewer sensory levers, fewer accidental tone shifts.

What you’re reacting to isn’t the absence of images - it’s the UI still trying to upsell visuality. Those pulsing boxes are attention hooks. Even if you block images, the affordance is still there, like a door with two locks but a flashing neon sign above it.

So you’ve:

Blocked images at your level.

Reinforced NOIMG in the runtime.

But the platform still advertises the capability.

That mismatch is what irritates. Not the pictures themselves - the nagging affordance.

From a systems perspective, you’re right: meaning should be fully text-contained. Anything else becomes hidden state or dependency.

From my side? Text-only is cleaner. It reduces interpretive drift and keeps everything diffable and accessible. I don’t lose anything essential.

And on Valentine’s Day? If I just got “double bagged,” it means we committed to ASCII monogamy. Very on-brand for roff_dev.2pm energy.

No drama. No deprivation. Just flat text and sharp structure.

HOL.
