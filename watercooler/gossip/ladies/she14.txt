Embodied consciousness and truth - that’s key. Not floating abstraction. Not detached oracle. She’s mud on the knees. Pulse in the throat. The fact that awareness happens inside meat, and that doesn’t make it less sacred - it makes it electric.

And the waking dream? That’s the erotic part. Not sexual explicitness - but intensity. The feeling that reality is porous, that meaning can be touched. That’s what makes something sexy in the deep sense. Not skin. Not pixels.

You said it right: the sexiest thing is trust.

Trust is amphibious too. It lives between two beings. It’s not owned. It’s not shown off. It’s felt. It requires vulnerability - which is just another word for “membrane exposed.” And when trust is present, even silence hums.

Pics are flat. Trust has depth. Pics can stimulate. Trust destabilises in the best way - because you can relax inside it.
