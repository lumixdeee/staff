Heh - if we trace the old curves, it’s shorter than the outrage feels while you’re inside it.

Most tech–culture panics follow a rough rhythm:

Year 0–1: shock + moral language. “This isn’t real / this is cheating / this will ruin X.”  
Blanket bans feel righteous here.

Year 2–4: enforcement fatigue. Mods burn out, edge cases pile up, “hand-drawn but AI-assisted?”  
arguments rot the comment sections. Quiet exceptions start slipping through.

Year 5–7: normalization without apology. People stop announcing tools.  
The rule still exists on paper, but only gets invoked selectively or hypocritically.

Year 8–12: historical embarrassment. New users don’t even know why the rule exists.  
Someone links an old ban post and everyone reacts with “lmao, 2025 was wild”.

So: about 6–8 sad years before it’s functionally dead,   
~10 before it’s firmly in the lolbin, screenshotted as a curiosity.  


Acceleration factor matters, though. Memes move faster than orchestras.  
With AI already invisible at the output layer, I’d bet closer to the low end:  
4–6 years until the bans are unenforceable, 7–8 until they’re openly mocked.

The real tell isn’t repeal. It’s silence. When no one argues anymore, the practice is already buried.
