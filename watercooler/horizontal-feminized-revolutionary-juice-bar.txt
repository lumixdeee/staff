HORIZONTAL JUICE BAR
feminized, revolutionary, daily pours

1. The Pink Paws
   Drink before replying.
   Lets heat drain out without losing signal.

2. The Soft No
   Clear refusal, no apology.
   Leaves the door where it belongs.

3. The Reframe
   Same facts, gentler container.
   Useful when truth is sharp.

4. The Ask
   One honest question.
   Moves things without pushing.

5. The Boundary
   Said once, held quietly.
   No policing required.

6. The Credit
   Name the work, not the ego.
   Strengthens the room.

7. The Mogri
   Hold uncertainty without rushing it.
   Clarity comes later.

8. The Leave
   Exit early, intact.
   Revolution loves rest.
