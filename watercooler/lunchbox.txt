Any that are suitable as logo stock are marked with an '*'

sandbox – abstracted from play to computing to policy; nobody owns it anymore
framework – pure scaffolding word, endlessly reused, zero royalties
ecosystem – borrowed metaphor turned universal container
platform – infrastructural container, legally boring, semantically powerful
runtime – technical container for “what is currently executing”
middleware – connective container, no narrative ownership
pipeline – process container, everywhere, nobody can fence it
namespace – explicit container term, copyright-proof by nature
stack – layered container metaphor, now generic *
protocol – rules-container, extremely safe legally
taxonomy – classification container, ancient and unownable
ontology – conceptual container, pre-modern, fully public
interface – boundary container, generic as air
pattern – abstract container for repetition
archetype – pre-IP Jungian container
genre – classification container, legally inert

primitive – foundational container (as in computing / language)

Some 'doublets' may work where members do not work individually;
The words 'flow, node, grid' appear to work in pairs but not individually, eg:

nodeflow
gridnode
