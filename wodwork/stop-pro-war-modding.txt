Have you noticed cases where moderation rules end up blocking criticism of something because  
they classify it by keywords rather than intent?

For example, anti-war posts flagged as “war content”, satire treated as endorsement,  
or critique of a policy being removed under rules meant to stop promotion of that same policy.

I’m curious whether people see this as an unavoidable trade-off, or a structural flaw in  
how large platforms moderate discussion.
