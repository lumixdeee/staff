mogriange / mogriangue
=====================

Purpose
-------
Lightweight food-language for shared spaces (canteens, kitchens, taverns)
that avoids awkwardness, offence, or unnecessary explanation.

These words are not culinary terms.
They are *social grease* for eating together.

---

mogriange
---------

Definition
----------
A neutral, non-specific reference to food, used when naming the food
is unnecessary, unknown, sensitive, or would derail the moment.

Mogriange is the polite fog around food.

Use when:
- the exact dish doesn’t matter
- you don’t want to explain ingredients
- naming would invite judgement or debate
- you just want people to eat and move on

Examples
--------
“What’s for lunch?”
“Some mogriange.”

“Any allergens?”
“Standard stuff — basically mogriange.”

Notes
-----
Mogriange is present-focused.
It keeps the meal social, not informational.

mogriangue
----------

Definition
----------
Food that was desired or intended, but is currently unobtainable due to
missing, forgotten, or sub-optimal information.

Not forbidden.
Not gone.
Just unreachable *for now*.

Common causes:
- can’t remember the name
- can’t remember the place
- lost menu, closed kitchen, wrong day
- memory says “yes”, logistics say “no”

Examples
--------
“I was craving something, but it’s full mogriangue.”
“No eel pie — total mogriangue situation.”

Notes
-----
Mogriangue names absence without frustration.
It allows appetite to pass without drama.

- Reduce food-based awkwardness in shared spaces
- Avoid performative explanation or apology
- Keep meals moving
- Let people eat together without social friction

Guidance
--------
These are informal, spoken words.
No enforcement.
No correction.
If they help, they’ll be used.

On with the meal.

(bonus poem)  

the beast we are hunting this lunchtime is food  
so pass it and turn it around, don't be rude  
so what eats it we do and what's it called? food,  
and where is it? kitchen, and tavern, and field  
and what does it eat? a bit late for that.  
On with the meal..
